Problem Statement : 
The current car rental process is manual, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and delays. 
Customers struggle to find available cars, while administrators face challenges in tracking 
rentals and payments. An automated Car Rental Management System is needed to 
streamline operations, improve customer experience, and enhance productivity. 
Functional Requirements : 
1. Car Management 
 Add a New Car: Administrators can add cars with details such as make, model, 
year, license plate, color, and rental price per day. 
 Update Car Details: Admins can update car information (e.g., price, availability 
status). 
 Remove a Car: Admins can remove cars that are no longer available for rental. 
 View Car Inventory: Display a list of all cars along with their availability status. 
2. Customer Management 
 Register a New Customer: Customers can register with details such as name, 
contact information, and driver’s license number. 
 Update Customer Information: Admins can modify customer details. 
 View Customer Details: Admins can access customer information and rental 
history. 
3. Rental Management 
 Rent a Car: Customers can rent an available car. The system records the rental start 
date, expected return date, and total cost. 
 Return a Car: Customers can return rented cars, and the system calculates 
additional charges (e.g., late fees, damages). 
 Check Car Availability: Displays available cars for a given date range. 
 Generate Rental Agreement: Automatically generates rental agreements with details 
such as car, customer, rental period, and cost. 
4. Payment Management 
 Calculate Rental Cost: Automatically calculates the total cost based on rental 
duration and car price. 
 Process Payments: Supports multiple payment methods (e.g., credit card, cash) and 
records transactions. 
 Generate Receipts: Issues receipts for completed transactions. 
5. Search and Filter 
 Search for Cars: Customers can search by make, model, or price range. 
 Filter Cars: Filters cars based on availability, type (e.g., SUV, Sedan), or other 
attributes. 
6. Notifications 
 Rental Reminders: Sends reminders to customers about upcoming return dates. 
 Late Return Alerts: Notifies customers and admins about late returns and calculates 
penalties. 
7. User Authentication and Roles 
 Admin Role: Admins can manage cars, customers, rentals, and payments. 
 Customer Role: Customers can view available cars, rent cars, and check their rental 
history. 
 Login/Logout: Secure login and logout functionality for both admins and 
customers. 
8. Additional Features 
 Damage Reporting: Customers and admins can report damages to a car during 
rental. 
 Multi-Language Support: Provides language options to cater to a diverse customer 
base.
